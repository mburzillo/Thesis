## File Descriptions


**Calculating_1930_City_Population.RMD** contains all calculations/data reshaping to take IPUMS files and find city populations for 1930. Final dataset includes city code, name, state, and population for all cities and all cities with Richmond HOLC maps (city_pop_name_1930_in_richmond). 

**all_holc_files_cleaning.RMD:** this takes in the shapefile from the Richmond webiste with all HOLC shapefiles and cleans it. This file also joins this geographic data with city populations from 1930 from the data generated by Calculating_1930_City_Population.RMD.

**combining_missing_and_all_holc_files.RMD:** this takes the shapefiles that were found to be missing from the fullshpfile file from Richmond (which was supposed to contain them all) and creates a master shapefile containing these files and the fullshpfile file.

**demo_tract_merge.RMD** takes in the all_cities_tract_grades dataset created by the overlay_calcs.RMD and joins it with the demographic data at the tract level from 1960 for analysis. Produces the all_cities_grade_demo.csv file which will be the final dataset to export to Stata for regression analysis. 

**csv 1930 data** this was generated by taking the full 1930 Census sample from IPUMS. observations with cities with code 0 were first dropped, as these indicate "Not in identifiable city (or size group)." Then, the individual level observations were collapsed by year, city, and citypop and the perwts were summed. 

## To Generate Data for Initial Model Explaining Tract Grades

1) Combine all files with *combining_holc_files.RMD*
2) Upload resultant shape file *"all_holc_shape_files.shp"* to QGIS
3) Perform intersection with 1960 Census tract boundaries
4) Calculate relevant areas for intersection
5) Save as csv to re-import to r as *"all_cities_overlay.csv"*
6) Run *overlay_calcs.RMD* to produce the dataset of tracts assigned with HOLC grades
7) Run *demo_tract_merge.RMD* to join the HOLC graded tract data with the demographic tract level data from IPUMS to create the final dataset for analysis


## Outdated Files
**combining_holc_files.RMD:** creates on shapefile containing all of the relevant HOLC city files for the treatment group (40-50k pop) by combining all the files in the "Shapefiles/Richmond HOLC Files" folder. Adds in variables for city name, state, and map year based on the the HOLC fodler names for each city downloaded from the Richmond Mapping Inequality website.

**overlay_calcs.RMD** takes in the area overlay file from ArcGIS and assigns HOLC grades to each Census tract. Also creates an indicator for any tracts that are less than 50% covered by HOLC areas and any tract that receives a grade that represents less than 50% of the graded area in that tract. Creates the "all_cities_tract_grades" dataset which holds all the census tracts and assigned grades for analysis.
