## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r load data, include = FALSE}

test_intersect_2010_1960 <- read.csv("Overlay Files from QGIS/test_intersect_2010_1960.csv") %>%
  mutate(intersect_over_tract = intersect_2010_1960_area/SHAPE_AREA)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r summarize}
test_intersect_2010_1960 %>%
  mutate(count = 1) %>%
  group_by(GISJOIN) %>%
  summarise(sum_count = sum(count)) %>%
  summarise(mean_intersect_areas_in_1960_tract = mean(sum_count),
            median_intersect_areas_in_1960_tract = median(sum_count))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

# lots of the intersect areas represent negligible areas
test_intersect_2010_1960 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = intersect_over_tract)) +
  geom_histogram()
```


```{r}
# Q: how many tracts only have 1 intersect area? 595 out of the 961 tracts are 90% covered by 1 area

test_intersect_2010_1960 %>%
  filter(intersect_over_tract > .90 )

```
