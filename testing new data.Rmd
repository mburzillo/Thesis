## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
data_for_analysis_master_shapefile <- read_csv("data_for_analysis_master_shapefile.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
testing_2 <- data_for_analysis_master_shapefile %>% 
  mutate(count = 1) %>% 
  group_by(state, city, citypop_total) %>% 
  summarize(sum = sum(count)) %>%
  filter(citypop_total > 0) %>%
  select(-citypop_total, -sum)

# this shows our new data has added 2 cities - Atlantic city and OK city
anti_join(testing, testing_2)

anti_join(testing_2, testing)


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
