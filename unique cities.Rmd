## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
tract_selected_new <- read.csv("tracts_selected.csv")
```


```{r cars}

ipums_1930_for_join <- ipums_1930_cities_by_pop_full_sample %>%
  select(cityname, state, CITY_old)

```


```{r}
cities_selected <- tract_selected_new %>%
  group_by(cityname, state_ab) %>%
  summarise(mean_area = mean(tract_area))
```


```{r}
city_ipums_correspondence <- left_join(cities_selected, ipums_1930_for_join, by = c("cityname" = "cityname", "state_ab" = "state")) 

write.csv(city_ipums_correspondence, "city_ipums.csv")

unique(city_ipums_correspondence$CITY_old)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
