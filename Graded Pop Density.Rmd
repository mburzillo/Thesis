## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r loading data}

colnames(data_for_analysis)

half_coverage <- data_for_analysis %>%
  filter(area_accounted_for >= .5)

  
  
mean(half_coverage$pop_density, na.rm = T)
median(half_coverage$pop_density, na.rm = T)
sd(half_coverage$pop_density, na.rm = T)

quantile(half_coverage$pop_density, probs = c(.1, .9), na.rm = T)
```
```{r}
half_coverage %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pop_density)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 100)
```

```{r}
half_coverage_20_60_range <- half_coverage %>%
  filter(citypop_total <=60000, citypop_total >= 20000)

mean(half_coverage_20_60_range$pop_density, na.rm = T)
median(half_coverage_20_60_range$pop_density, na.rm = T)
sd(half_coverage$pop_density, na.rm = T)

quantile(half_coverage_20_60_range$pop_density, probs = c(.1, .25, .75, .9, .99, 1), na.rm = T)

half_coverage_20_60_range %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = pop_density)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 100)


ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = half_coverage_20_60_range$pop_density, fill = "Red", alpha =.5)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = half_coverage$pop_density, fill = "Blue", alpha = .5)) 

# cut off
